# Visual-Similarity-Based-Recommendation-System
- It is a very basic recommender system that shows products similar to given product based on their visual similarities. 
- Pre-trained CNN model from Keras are used to extract the image features using Transfer Learning. To calculate similarity between images cosine similarity is calculated for these image feature vectors.
- VGG16, ResNet50, VGG19, Xception, MobileNet models are used as feature extractors on same corpus of images and results are visualised seperately for each model.
